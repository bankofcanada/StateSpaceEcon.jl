    em_impute_kalman!(EY, Y, kfd)

Fill in any missing values with their expected values according to the 
Kalman smoother.

* `Y` is the original data with `NaN` values where data is missing.
* `kfd` is the KalmanFilterData instance containing the output from Kalman
  filter and Kalman smoother.
* `EY` is modified in place. Where `Y` contains a `NaN`, the corresponding 
  entries in `EY` are imputed. The rest of `EY` is not modified.

NOTE: It is assumed that `EY` equals `Y` everywhere where `Y` is not `NaN`, 
however, this is neither checked nor enforced.

    em_impute_interpolation!(EY, Y, IT)

Fill in any missing values using interpolation.

* `Y` is the original data with `NaN` values where data is missing.
* `IT` is an instance of `Interpolations.InterpolationType`. Default is
  `AkimaMonotonicInterpolation`. See documentation of `Interpolations.jl`
  package for details and other interpolation choices.
* `EY` is modified in place. Where `Y` contains a `NaN`, the corresponding 
  entries in `EY` are imputed. The rest of `EY` is not modified.

however, this is neither checked nor enforced.
